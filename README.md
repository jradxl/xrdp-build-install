# xrdp Build and Install
Xrdp source code build and install

xrdp installed by a package manager always seems out of date.
So here is a build and install script....
I noticed that Ubuntu/Debian install as an xrdp user, which seems more secure to me. I used the deb sources to get some ideas on how, and then worked out how it could be done.

**as-xrdp**  
Runs "xrdp" as the user xrdp, and xrdp-sesman as root
<br>
<br>


**as-root**  
Very simple build and install from the github sources
